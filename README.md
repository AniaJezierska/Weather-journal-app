# Weather-Journal App Project

This project requires creating an asynchronous web application that uses the web API and user data to dynamically update the Weather-Journal UI.

## Dependency installation
```
npm install
```
```
npm install cors
```
```
npm install express
```
```
npm install body-parser
```

## Running the server

Run in the project directory
```
node server.js
```

## Go to the application

Go to the browser and open
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) 

Submitting the form will send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and return the weather information for that location.
